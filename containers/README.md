# Containers

This is the root folder for custom Dockerfiles that provide ready-to-use images to be run on CSCS cluster (mainly Alps: Eiger or Daint).

Please, refer to [Scientific IT's official documentation](https://empa-scientific-it.github.io/docs/compute/cscs/recipes/build_docker_image/) to learn more about how to build and run the containers.
